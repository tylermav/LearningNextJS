# LearningNextJS
My repo to learning NextJS

Original files were taught using JS & CSS. I spiced it up using TS & SCSS.

At the current time all files were copied and pasted via the tutorial. Typescript files are still a WIP.

Link to the tutorial I used: [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)

# Instructions
